Currently, it employs an updated Chiaki package with Steam Deck enhancements I have dubbed chiaki4deck . I have created the accompanying chiaki4deck flatpak as a means to provide updates to Chiaki for Steam Deck users . I am contributing the updates upstream to the main Chiaki project with the hope that they are added despite it currently being in maintenance mode. Getting Started \u00b6 Start by visiting the Setup section and following each of the subsections to learn how to setup Chiaki for the best experience on your Steam Deck using chiaki4deck . Getting Updates \u00b6 Visit chiaki4deck Releases for instructions on updating to the newest release, with notes for each release. Additional Information \u00b6 About Chiaki \u00b6 Chiaki is a \"Free and Open Source PlayStation Remote Play Client\" licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 (AGPL V3). This license enables anyone to share and modify the source code to add additional features on the condition that they make those publicly available (copy-left) and also license them under the same AGPL V3 license. This package currently has an official flatpak on flathub which you can install on the Steam Deck. About chiaki4deck \u00b6 chiaki4deck aims to provide tips and tricks on using Chiaki with the Steam Deck. In the spirit of Chiaki being open source, I have made changes to the Chiaki project to optimize the experience on my Steam Deck and am sharing how to access and use those enhancements on this site. Furthermore, I have submitted a patch to bring the first set of completed updates to the \"official\" Chiaki repo. Additionally, I plan to submit future updates as patches and hope they will be added despite the Chiaki project being in maintenance mode. If they are added, all of the chiaki4deck documentation here will also apply to the official Chiaki flatpak. What is the chiaki4deck flatpak? I have provided a flatpak with my updates named chiaki4deck (to distinguish it from the official Chiaki release to avoid confusion if users have both installed) as a solution for users that want an easy way to use these improvements on their Steam Deck. For installation instructions, see the Installation section For users that want to build from source, I have also provided the updated source code on the accompanying GitHub repo (the link to the GitHub is on the top right [top left menu on mobile] of the site banner you see if you scroll to the top of any page). Instructions for this are in the DIY section . As it stands, a lot of the documentation applies to the general Chiaki flatpak in addition to the chiaki4deck flatpak, but instructions are specifically tailored to chiaki4deck and the updates included therein. To use this documentation with the Chiaki flatpak replace re.chiaki.Chiaki4deck with re.chiaki.Chiaki where applicable and note that the features listed in the Updates section will not work with that version (they only work with chiaki4deck until the main Chiaki flatpak gets an update.) Submitting Documentation Updates \u00b6 If you want to update the documentation to add helpful information of your own, you can scroll to the top of your current page and click the pencil icon on the top right (to the right of the current page's title) to make edits and submit them for approval. Making Suggestions for Improvements to the Documentation \u00b6 Please submit general issues to the chiaki4deck GitHub as well as specific issues related to a given page by clicking the underneath \"Was this page helpful?\" and opening the feedback form for the page you think needs updating.

Please switch into Desktop Mode for this process. Steam Deck Speaker Fails to Load, Crashing Official Chiaki and chiaki4deck in Desktop Mode In Desktop Mode, the Steam Deck speaker (Raven) can fail to load on startup. This is rare but seems to happen every once in a while. Unfortunately, this reliably crashes Chiaki and by inheritance chiaki4deck , causing it to hang indefinitely. The only ways to exit Chiaki are to close the konsole window that launched it (if launched via automation), forcibly kill the process ( kill -9 ) or forcibly shutoff the Steam Deck. I am working on a way to prevent this from crashing Chiaki in a bugfix (and hopefully someone is working on the underlying Steam Deck speaker driver issue causing this). In the meantime, there are 2 good workarounds that prevent this from occurring (either one works). Please use one of the following when using Chiaki or chiaki4deck : After booting into Desktop Mode, adjust the volume of the Steam Deck (hit the + or -) volume button (only needs to be done once per boot). You will see this cause Raven to load if it hasn't already. Now, you are safe to launch either Chiaki or chiaki4deck at any time until you turn off your Steam Deck.

So Why Should I Care? This is especially convenient for the Steam Deck's Game Mode where an automated launch eliminates both the need to tap furiously at your touchscreen to launch the application and the glitches that would arise (flashes on your screen) when it would switch between the 2 open Chiaki windows (since only 1 window is opened with the automated launch). It also gives a default game mode option to launch in fullscreen, stretch or zoomed mode, making it easier to use the 3 games modes . Finally, it allows for passing your login passcode automatically instead of manually typing in each time (for those of you with a login passcode set on your PlayStation console). Sleep Mode Required For this to work, your PlayStation needs to either be in rest/sleep mode or on (so that it is listening for the wake up signal). This means you will want to keep your PlayStation in rest/sleep mode when you are not playing (instead of off).

If you just need help, you can reach me via Reddit or email Close chiaki4deck gracefully by closing any open dialog boxes and then using Ctrl + Q on the stream window. If chiaki4deck doesn't close gracefully, move your mouse to the top left corner of the stream window and a blue circle should highlight the corner of the screen. Click on it to see all of your windows and select the konsole window. Then, close the konsole window itself (click its x icon in the top right corner). Next, you can relaunch the script again to make sure it wasn't a one-time snafu. Note: Chiaki seems to perform better (audio/visual quality) in Game Mode vs. Desktop Mode for me.

So Why Should I Care? This is especially convenient for the Steam Deck's Game Mode where an automated launch eliminates both the need to tap furiously at your touchscreen to launch the application and the glitches that would arise (flashes on your screen) when it would switch between the 2 open Chiaki windows (since only 1 window is opened with the automated launch). It also gives a default game mode option to launch in fullscreen, stretch or zoomed mode, making it easier to use the 3 games modes . Finally, it allows for passing your login passcode automatically instead of manually typing in each time (for those of you with a login passcode set on your PlayStation console). Sleep Mode Required For this to work, your PlayStation needs to either be in rest/sleep mode or on (so that it is listening for the wake up signal). This means you will want to keep your PlayStation in rest/sleep mode when you are not playing (instead of off). Steam Deck Speaker Fails to Load, Crashing Official Chiaki and chiaki4deck in Desktop Mode In Desktop Mode, the Steam Deck speaker (Raven) can fail to load on startup. This is rare but seems to happen every once in a while. Unfortunately, this reliably crashes Chiaki and by inheritance chiaki4deck , causing it to hang indefinitely. The only ways to exit Chiaki are to close the konsole window that launched it (if launched via automation), forcibly kill the process ( kill -9 ) or forcibly shutoff the Steam Deck. I am working on a way to prevent this from crashing Chiaki in a bugfix (and hopefully someone is working on the underlying Steam Deck speaker driver issue causing this). In the meantime, there are 2 good workarounds that prevent this from occurring (either one works). Please use one of the following when using Chiaki or chiaki4deck : After booting into Desktop Mode, adjust the volume of the Steam Deck (hit the + or -) volume button (only needs to be done once per boot). You will see this cause Raven to load if it hasn't already. Now, you are safe to launch either Chiaki or chiaki4deck at any time until you turn off your Steam Deck. OR Use chiaki4deck and/or Chiaki in Game Mode when possible; the speaker not loading hardware error doesn't occur there. Open a konsole session (launch it via Applications by clicking the Steam icon in the bottom left and searching for it in the All Applications section) Get your PlayStation IP Get your registered PlayStation's IP Address Launch Chiaki via your desktop or via: flatpak run re.chiaki.Chiaki4deck Get your IP address via the console widget and then close the window and return to the konsole session Create script for waking PlayStation and launching Chiaki Automated Instructions (Recommended) Manual Instructions (For People who like to do things by hand) Run the gen-launcher script using the following command in your konsole and answer the prompts (you will need your IP address from step 2 above) bash < ( curl -sLo- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streetpea/chiaki4deck/main/scripts/gen-launcher.sh ) What Do the Different Modes (i.e., fullscreen [uses Normal], zoom, stretch) Look Like?

This is rare but seems to happen every once in a while. Unfortunately, this reliably crashes Chiaki and by inheritance chiaki4deck , causing it to hang indefinitely. The only ways to exit Chiaki are to close the konsole window that launched it (if launched via automation), forcibly kill the process ( kill -9 ) or forcibly shutoff the Steam Deck. I am working on a way to prevent this from crashing Chiaki in a bugfix (and hopefully someone is working on the underlying Steam Deck speaker driver issue causing this). In the meantime, there are 2 good workarounds that prevent this from occurring (either one works). Please use one of the following when using Chiaki or chiaki4deck : After booting into Desktop Mode, adjust the volume of the Steam Deck (hit the + or -) volume button (only needs to be done once per boot). You will see this cause Raven to load if it hasn't already. Now, you are safe to launch either Chiaki or chiaki4deck at any time until you turn off your Steam Deck.

It worked! It didn't work Purrfect You were able to launch your stream and connect. Maybe, you even got a game running. An error occurred Please try closing and re-launching to make sure it wasn't some sort of temporary snafu (maybe your console was updating something and didn't want to let you connect right away). Make sure your PlayStation appears in the Chiaki menu, is labelled (registered) and is animated with either an orange ( State: standby ) or blue ( State: ready ) light. Choosing your Remote Play Settings \u00b6 Here are different settings you can use for Chiaki/ chiaki4deck depending on your network connection. The default configuration is for remote play on a home network only. This means that it is dependent only on the performance / strength of your wireless router (or ethernet connection) [recommended to connect the PlayStation console via ethernet and Steam Deck via wi-fi to optimize performance and portability] and not on your Internet (World Wide Web) connection. What does that mean for me? If you are in an area with bad Internet, as long as you have a good wireless router, you can get close to native performance. Open chiaki4deck and click the gear icon in the top right to open the settings menu Adjust the settings to your preferences. Below are the settings you'll want to try first with your PlayStation console (choose the PS5/1080p tab if you have a PS5 or the PS4/720p if you have a PS4). If you are having issues with your PS5 connection, please try the PS4/720p settings with your PS5 since they require significantly less bandwidth from your wireless router. PS5/1080P PS4/720P Stream output can be up to 1080p. Here are the settings that are currently working well for me. This results in a native-like experience for most games on my network/setup. Why 1080p if the Steam Deck is only 800p? Using 1080p results in a better picture for me than 720p. The biggest factor in this seems to be chroma-sub sampling . In simple terms, the colors for an image are compressed and so you get a much lower resolution of color data than your image resolution. This means a 1080p image (with a high bitrate) will have more color data than a 720p image even if the image resolution itself ends up being 720p (since the color resolution will be higher than the equivalent 720p picture's color resolution). This results in an image that has more pop to it. Thus, I recommend streaming at 1080p if you have the bandwidth (good enough wireless router). However, if you are having issues with your wireless connection (i.e choppy audio, flashes in your video, or lag) while playing, then please use 720p instead. The gains you get from 1080p are nice, but aren't worth having a bad connection. For PS4, the stream is limited to 720p. Using the defaults for most values works well here, resulting in native-like (albeit w/ a diminished resolution) experience for most games on my network/setup. Putting your PlayStation Console to Sleep Automatically For Action on Disconnect , choose Enter Sleep Mode to automatically put your PlayStation console to sleep as soon as you close your session with Ctrl + Q (you will add this shortcut as part of you controller configuration in controller section ). If you prefer, you can also use Ask (the default) to get prompted about putting your PlayStation to sleep when you close your session with Ctrl + Q . Performance of Chiaki/ chiaki4deck \u00b6 My Experience \u00b6 Ultimately, the performance will depend on the capability of your wireless router and which system ( \\(PS5 > PS4 Pro > PS4\\) ) you are using. Here are some notes from my experience using chiaki4deck on my Steam Deck with a PS5 console and a relatively good ( \\(450 Mbps\\) for \\(2.4GHz\\) / \\(1,300 Mbps\\) for \\(5GHz\\) ) wireless router. My Wireless Connection by the Numbers I'm using the \\(5GHz\\) band for chiaki4deck on my Steam Deck, meaning the total bandwidth for all devices on my local network is \\(1,300 Mbps\\) (remember Internet connection itself doesn't matter since we're only using our wireless router for local streaming). Since I am using the settings in Choosing Your Remote Play Settings , I'm using \\((30,000 + 19,200) Kbps \\approx 50 Mbps\\) out of the total of \\(1,300 Mbps\\) . This means I'm using about \\(4\\%\\) of my \\(5GHz\\) band. In other words, I still have plenty of bandwidth for watching Netflix while I play on my Steam Deck! What Performance Can I Expect? I am currently getting close to native performance using chiaki4deck on my Steam Deck with my PS5. This gives me better performance than I get playing performance heavy games directly on Steam Deck (like that one game where the kid gets bit by a ) Benefits: 5-6 hours of battery life (vs 1-2 hours playing the same games natively on Steam Deck) access to PlayStation collection (games I have already purchased or have via PS Plus) including exclusives Steam Deck quiet as a mouse (especially important when playing while watching a show with others) PlayStation Trophies Negatives: occasional performance issues with certain games (specifically games with VSync enabled) lack of native gyro (unless you attach DualSense controller via bluetooth or usb) for games that require it (i.e., Concrete Genie.) lack of native microphone support (I use Discord with my friends so not an issue for me, but could be for others). Games I've Played Successfully Using chiaki4deck So Far... Stray God of War (2018) Genshin Impact (turned off VSync in settings to get rid of white flashes during gameplay) Sekiro (occasional white flashes in areas with high crowds. Luckily, these went away as I got further in the game and never affected my ability to progress. Unfortunately, this seems to be due to VSync being enabled automatically with no option to turn it off. It only affected about 3 hours of the game in total [12 flashes with 1 or 2 every 15-30 minutes or so] before it went away completely). Fall Guys MultiVersus Red Dead Redemption 2 Marvel's Spider Man Ghost of Tsushima (changed from Resolution Mode to Performance Mode in game settings for native-like performance) Chicory: A Colorful Tale Concrete Genie (Using DualSense Controller) Troubleshooting Performance Issues \u00b6 Examples of performance issues white flashes green flashes audio choppiness/crackling excessive lag To fix these issues, try the following: If you are not using the settings listed in Choosing Your Remote Play Settings , try with those settings and see if that fixes it for you. Switch to 720p from 1080p 720p requires less bandwidth than 1080p. This will help if your wireless connection is the problem, especially since it's very easy to do. This can fix video artifacts (white / green flashes) and audio choppiness (both results of connection problems). Try short preamble If you are still having trouble (I didn\u2019t need this but it can help in general and helped significantly improve performance for other streaming services such as Game Pass on my Steam Deck), try using using short preamble instead of long preamble in your router settings. You need to change this directly in your router settings for the given network and can do it per network if you set up more than one. This is incompatible with old devices (using wifi b/g instead of n or ac). Devices from 2011 and newer are required by law to support it and so will definitely work. Older devices may or may not support it depending on if they have either n or ac wireless support. Short preamble helps the \\(5GHz\\) connection for devices that support it (essentially anything that\u2019s connecting on a \\(5GHz\\) network should use it). For streaming, you can set up one network that uses short for your newer devices ( \\(5GHz\\) network for me) and one with long for older devices ( \\(2.4 GHz\\) network for me since older devices don\u2019t support \\(5GHz\\) anyway). My connection worked fine with long preamble on a \\(2.4 GHz\\) network for Chiaki but short (and a \\(5GHz\\) network for that matter) works better in general for devices that support it and has helped others using Chiaki as well as me to help reduce Game Pass streaming lag (which is still much worse than Chiaki and not close to native, but works well for games that don\u2019t require fast or moderately fast reaction times). For specific game issues, change game resolution settings For example, the game may be set to 4k / resolution mode even though it's only streaming at 1080p or even 720p. Additionally, it may be using HDR (which the Steam Deck screen doesn't support). Switching these settings off on a game level results in less processing power used on the game and thus more left over for streaming as well as hitting a higher framerate. For example, I switched Ghost of Tsushima from resolution mode to performance mode and noticed that the occasional performance problems I was experiencing evaporated and the visual quality became much more stable due to the lack of occasional stutters. It went from being playable but a noticeable downgrade to indistinguishable from native. Turn off VSync or the equivalent in games that use it VSync should only be enabled on the client side while streaming and having it enabled in the game itself can cause issues since it requires some extra overhead and can't actually sync with your screen if you're streaming the game. This resulted in issues with white flashes for me while playing Genshin Impact and Sekiro. When I turned off VSync in the Genshin Impact settings, these flashes (which had happened multiple times a minute with VSync on) disappeared. This affects only a small number of games, but is something to watch out for if you randomly have an issue with one game while others run well with Chiaki/ chiaki4deck . Switch framerate to 30fps 30fps requires less bandwidth than 60fps . This will help if your wireless connection is the problem, especially since it's very easy to do. This can fix video artifacts (white / green flashes) and audio choppiness (both results of connection problems). I put this last because it is the biggest performance downgrade and most of the time you don't need to do this. However, switching to 30fps / 720p at the default settings is the most surefire way to fix connection issues and a last resort if the methods with virtually no downsides don't do the trick. Chiaki/ chiaki4deck via Internet (Outside of Home Connection) \u00b6 Chiaki/ chiaki4deck Outside of your Home Network You can also open up ports to connect from the Internet, but the performance will not be as good, with increased input lag being the most noticeable downgrade. In this scenario, your connection will depend on both the Internet connection of your PlayStation console via the router and the Internet connection of your computer via your location (internet speeds themselves will apply). The farther away (more hops from your router) you get, the worse the performance will get. If you are still in the same state, it will likely still be relatively good. However, if you go cross-country or something like that, it can degrade significantly. Nevertheless, it can be very convenient to use while traveling, especially when playing less timing intensive games (i.e., games that would play well via cloud streaming).","title":"Configuration"},{"location":"setup/configuration/#configuring-chiaki4deck","text":"","title":"Configuring chiaki4deck"},{"location":"setup/configuration/#registering-your-playstation","text":"Upgrading from Using Chiaki Flatpak on Steam Deck New to Using Chiaki on Steam Deck Make sure you're on the right tab!

My connection worked fine with long preamble on a \\(2.4 GHz\\) network for Chiaki but short (and a \\(5GHz\\) network for that matter) works better in general for devices that support it and has helped others using Chiaki as well as me to help reduce Game Pass streaming lag (which is still much worse than Chiaki and not close to native, but works well for games that don\u2019t require fast or moderately fast reaction times). For specific game issues, change game resolution settings For example, the game may be set to 4k / resolution mode even though it's only streaming at 1080p or even 720p. Additionally, it may be using HDR (which the Steam Deck screen doesn't support). Switching these settings off on a game level results in less processing power used on the game and thus more left over for streaming as well as hitting a higher framerate. For example, I switched Ghost of Tsushima from resolution mode to performance mode and noticed that the occasional performance problems I was experiencing evaporated and the visual quality became much more stable due to the lack of occasional stutters. It went from being playable but a noticeable downgrade to indistinguishable from native. Turn off VSync or the equivalent in games that use it VSync should only be enabled on the client side while streaming and having it enabled in the game itself can cause issues since it requires some extra overhead and can't actually sync with your screen if you're streaming the game. This resulted in issues with white flashes for me while playing Genshin Impact and Sekiro. When I turned off VSync in the Genshin Impact settings, these flashes (which had happened multiple times a minute with VSync on) disappeared. This affects only a small number of games, but is something to watch out for if you randomly have an issue with one game while others run well with Chiaki/ chiaki4deck . Switch framerate to 30fps 30fps requires less bandwidth than 60fps . This will help if your wireless connection is the problem, especially since it's very easy to do. This can fix video artifacts (white / green flashes) and audio choppiness (both results of connection problems). I put this last because it is the biggest performance downgrade and most of the time you don't need to do this. However, switching to 30fps / 720p at the default settings is the most surefire way to fix connection issues and a last resort if the methods with virtually no downsides don't do the trick.","title":"Troubleshooting Performance Issues"},{"location":"setup/configuration/#chiakichiaki4deck-via-internet-outside-of-home-connection","text":"Chiaki/ chiaki4deck Outside of your Home Network You can also open up ports to connect from the Internet, but the performance will not be as good, with increased input lag being the most noticeable downgrade. In this scenario, your connection will depend on both the Internet connection of your PlayStation console via the router and the Internet connection of your computer via your location (internet speeds themselves will apply). The farther away (more hops from your router) you get, the worse the performance will get. If you are still in the same state, it will likely still be relatively good. However, if you go cross-country or something like that, it can degrade significantly. Nevertheless, it can be very convenient to use while traveling, especially when playing less timing intensive games (i.e., games that would play well via cloud streaming).","title":"Chiaki/chiaki4deck via Internet (Outside of Home Connection)"},{"location":"setup/controlling/","text":"Configuring Steam Deck Controller Profile \u00b6 Get all of the shortcuts mapped to Steam Deck controls.

In that instance, you would be changing the game name to the Steam App ID for that game which you can find by searching SteamDB here among other ways (i.e., looking at the # in the URL of the game on the Steam Store). Default Controller Profile \u00b6 The easiest way to configure all of the necessary shortcuts for chiaki4deck is to copy the profile I have created in the COMMUNITY LAYOUTS tab. Click the current layout box (it says: Browse Community Layouts for games without official controller support underneath it). Move to the COMMUNITY LAYOUTS tab and select chiaki4deck+ by gmoney23 (the original chiaki4deck layout was from before touchpad mapping to the trackpad and touchscreen was added) Default chiaki4deck Layout Mapping Full View \u00b6 Default chiaki4deck Layout Touchscreen Mapping \u00b6 Use native gestures and swiping the touchscreen to perform touchpad actions. Please keep in mind that the touchscreen is mapping to the PlayStation touchpad (that is what the PlayStation console / games expect) so it behaves like a touchpad (i.e., cursor position moves based on your gesture relative to the current cursor position instead of snapping to your finger location). This is important to note for games with a cursor such as Chicory: A Colorful Tale as it can seem weird when using a touchscreen but is actually correct / desired in this case. Use the edges of the touchscreen (top, bottom, left, or right 5% of the screen) to activate touch click. Games with Region-Based Touchpad Click For games that separate the PlayStation touchpad into 3 regions, you can use a left edge touchscreen tap for left touchpad click, right edge touchscreen tap for right touchpad click and top or bottom middle of the touchscreen tap for middle touchpad click. Default chiaki4deck Layout Trackpad Mapping \u00b6 I have mapped the left trackpad as the PlayStation button and the right trackpad as the PlayStation controller touchpad (press for touchpad click and swipe for touchpad gestures). This essentially works the exact same way as when you're playing with the DualSense of DualShock4 touchpad. You touch/swipe for gestures and click for touchpad click. The touchpad gestures are mapped using a mouse region with left mouse click on touch (i.e., simulates holding down the Left Button while moving a mouse) and the touchpad click is mapped to T . Right Click Works too Clicking the mouse Right Button instead of the T key would have the same effect. Default chiaki4deck Layout Back Button Mapping \u00b6 I have mapped L4 to the PlayStation button, L5 to end session ( Ctrl + Q ), R4 to zoom ( Ctrl + Z ), and R5 to stretch ( Ctrl + S ). Default chiaki4deck Layout Gyro Mapping \u00b6 I have also mapped gyro controls As joystick . Whenever you touch the right joystick, you can move the Steam Deck to aim / control the camera with motion (gyro) controls. You can use this on its own or for small adjustments to larger camera movements made by directly moving the right joystick. You can always change this by choosing to edit the layout and going into the gyro settings. Creating your Own Controller Profile \u00b6 You can create your own controller profile by mapping the relevant buttons. The special button mappings (functions not assigned to the controller by default) [set these] and the standard button mappings (controls that directly map and are thus assigned by default) [no need to set these unless you prefer different mappings] are listed in tables below for your convenience. Special Button Mappings (You need to assign these yourself) \u00b6 Function Button Description Quit Ctrl + Q Close chiaki4deck cleanly, putting console in sleep mode if desired Zoom Ctrl + Z Toggle between zoom (zoomed in to eliminate borders, cutting off edge of screen) and non-zoom (black borders) Stretch Ctrl + S Toggle between stretch (stretched to eliminate borders, distorting aspect ratio of image), and non-stretch (black borders with default aspect ratio) PlayStation Button Esc The PlayStation / home button as it normally functions on a PlayStation controller Share Button F The Share button on the PS5 controller used for taking screenshots, videos, etc. stored on your PS5 and uploaded to the PlayStation app on your phone if you so choose. Touchpad Click T , mouse Right Button , tapping border (top, bottom, left or right 5%) of the touchscreen These actions will all result in a touchpad click. For games that separate the touchpad into multiple regions, they work in conjunction with either the current mouse location (location of finger on Steam Deck trackpad) or current finger location (which edge of the touchscreen you tapped) to delineate which region you are using (most games just have one region for touchpad click though). Touchpad Motion Touchscreen touch , mouse Left Button + Mouse Movement (i.e., drag action / mouse region touch). Maps to the PlayStation touchpad (since that's what PlayStation games / the remote streaming console expect). This means that the \"cursor\" (if one is defined for the game like in Chicory: A Colorful Tale ) moves according to your gestures but does not snap/follow your fingers' locations (i.e., it behaves like a touchpad as it should). Two Button Shortcuts If you want to create a shortcut that includes 2 buttons like Ctrl + Q , add the first key (i.e., Ctrl ) and then click the gear icon to the right of the added command (i.e., Ctrl ) and select Add sub command . Finally, fill in the new blank rectangle that appears with the desired second key (i.e., Q ) Using Steam Deck Controller Touchscreen in Your Custom Controller Profile \u00b6 In order to use the Steam Deck touchscreen as a touchscreen instead of a mouse in Game Mode, you need to enable Touchscreen Native Support for it in controller options (this is done for you in the default chiaki4deck layout chiaki4deck+ ). For your custom controller profile, do the following: Edit your controller layout and scroll down to the Action Sets tab (on the left menu). Click the gear icon to the right of the given action set (i.e., Default ). Select Add Always-On command . Move to the SYSTEM tab (use R1 to switch tabs) and select Touchscreen Native Support from the commands. Your Action Sets tab should now look like the following: Standard Button Mappings (These directly map and don't need to be specifically set) \u00b6 Function Button right joystick right joystick left joystick left joystick dpad up dpad up dpad left dpad left dpad down dpad down dpad right dpad right start button option button triangle Y button square X button cross A button circle B button R1 R1 R2 R2 R3 R3 (right-stick click) L1 L1 L2 L2 L3 L3 (left-stick click) Gyro Controls \u00b6 Native Gyro Support As of now, gyro does not directly map for games that support it (i.e., Concrete genie) on the Steam Deck controller. In order to get around this, you can either: Remap controls in accessibility options if the specific game supports that. Connect a DualSense or DualShock4 controller following Using a DualSense and/or DualShock4 Controller with chiaki4deck below. In the future, I plan to update chiaki4deck to support native gyro for the Steam Deck controller (like I have done for touch controls). This affects a small subset of games. However, it is important to note when thinking of which games to play with Chiaki/ chiaki4deck . Additionally, you can use gyro controls for camera options with any game (with gyro in the game itself turned off) by mapping gyro As joystick and adding a condition for when it's used (i.e., On with a condition of right joystick touch ) in the gyro settings for chiaki4deck . I have done this in the default chiaki4deck control setting and you can do it in your custom control scheme. Using a DualSense and/or DualShock4 Controller with chiaki4deck \u00b6 While most users will want to just use chiaki4deck with the Steam Deck controller, you can also attach a DualShock 4 or DualSense controller via bluetooth or usbc. The controls will map automatically and there is even native touchpad (including gestures) and gyro support. This can be especially useful if you're playing chiaki4deck when connected to an external monitor or TV or if you just really like the feel of the traditional PlayStation controllers. Pairing your DualShock 4 / DualSense with Steam Deck via Bluetooth While holding the Share button, hold the PlayStation Button to put your controller into pairing mode. On the Steam Deck, hit the STEAM button and then select the Settings tab and then the Bluetooth tab (i.e., STEAM button->Settings->Bluetooth ). Then, select your device from the list of devices. Once paired, it will automatically connect in the future when you press the PlayStation button on the controller. Enabling chiaki4deck to Work with DualSense / DualShock 4 Gyro and Touchpad \u00b6 Password Required This requires setting a password for your Steam Deck (if you haven't already). This is because you have to give access to the PlayStation controllers' accelerometer/gyroscope and touchpad to your user so that chiaki4deck can read them using libevdev . This itself is not dangerous, but changing udev rules in general can be which is why this is a restricted action that requires the use of sudo (with a password). Once you set your password, you need to make sure you put it in your password manager or remember it. Otherwise, if you ever need to use a command that requires a password again, you won't be able to use it and will have to use the recovery instructions for the Steam Deck . Please don't let this be you! Open a konsole session Set a password (if you don't already have one) and save it safely. (i.e., password manager). passwd Add udev rules for PlayStation controllers' touchpads and accelerometers (gyroscopes) Download the 71-chiaki4deck.rules udev rules file from GitHub using the following konsole command: curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streetpea/chiaki4deck/main/doc/71-chiaki4deck.rules Look at the file to see the rules cat 71 -chiaki4deck.rules 71-chiaki4deck.rules # Enable access to Touchpad and accelerometer (gyro) for DualShock4 & DualSense controllers for PlayStation Remote Play # DualShock 4 # USB SUBSYSTEM==\"input\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"054c\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"05c4\", ENV{ID_INPUT_TOUCHPAD}==\"?*\", TAG+=\"uaccess\" SUBSYSTEM==\"input\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"054c\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"05c4\", ENV{ID_INPUT_ACCELEROMETER}==\"?*\", TAG+=\"uaccess\" # Bluetooth SUBSYSTEM==\"input\", KERNELS==\"*054C:05C4*\", ENV{ID_INPUT_TOUCHPAD}==\"?*\", TAG+=\"uaccess\" SUBSYSTEM==\"input\", KERNELS==\"*054C:05C4*\", ENV{ID_INPUT_ACCELEROMETER}==\"?*\", TAG+=\"uaccess\" # DualShock 4 wireless adapter # USB SUBSYSTEM==\"input\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"054c\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"0ba0\", ENV{ID_INPUT_TOUCHPAD}==\"?*\", TAG+=\"uaccess\" SUBSYSTEM==\"input\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"054c\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"0ba0\", ENV{ID_INPUT_ACCELEROMETER}==\"?*\", TAG+=\"uaccess\" # Bluetooth SUBSYSTEM==\"input\", KERNELS==\"*054C:0BA0*\", ENV{ID_INPUT_TOUCHPAD}==\"?*\", TAG+=\"uaccess\" SUBSYSTEM==\"input\", KERNELS==\"*054C:0BA0*\", ENV{ID_INPUT_ACCELEROMETER}==\"?*\", TAG+=\"uaccess\" # DualShock 4 Slim # USB SUBSYSTEM==\"input\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"054c\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"09cc\", ENV{ID_INPUT_TOUCHPAD}==\"?*\", TAG+=\"uaccess\" SUBSYSTEM==\"input\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"054c\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"09cc\", ENV{ID_INPUT_ACCELEROMETER}==\"?*\", TAG+=\"uaccess\" # Bluetooth SUBSYSTEM==\"input\", KERNELS==\"*054C:09CC*\", ENV{ID_INPUT_TOUCHPAD}==\"?*\", TAG+=\"uaccess\" SUBSYSTEM==\"input\", KERNELS==\"*054C:09CC*\", ENV{ID_INPUT_ACCELEROMETER}==\"?*\", TAG+=\"uaccess\" # PS5 DualSense controller # USB SUBSYSTEM==\"input\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"054c\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"0ce6\", ENV{ID_INPUT_TOUCHPAD}==\"?*\", TAG+=\"uaccess\" SUBSYSTEM==\"input\", ATTRS{idVendor}==\"054c\", ATTRS{idProduct}==\"0ce6\", ENV{ID_INPUT_ACCELEROMETER}==\"?*\", TAG+=\"uaccess\" # Bluetooth SUBSYSTEM==\"input\", KERNELS==\"*054C:0CE6*\", ENV{ID_INPUT_TOUCHPAD}==\"?*\", TAG+=\"uaccess\" SUBSYSTEM==\"input\", KERNELS==\"*054C:0CE6*\", ENV{ID_INPUT_ACCELEROMETER}==\"?*\", TAG+=\"uaccess\" Why do I Need to Add Udev Rules? Udev rules control which devices you can access. The default rules for SteamOS give access to all joystick devices, but not touchpad or gyro devices because some of them are used in non-gaming electronics. Therefore, we need to give your user access to the PlayStation controllers' gyro and trackpad devices so chiaki4deck can read their events (so you can use the devices while playing). I have created and tested a file to give the minimum amount of permissions to accomplish what we need. 054c is Sony's Vendor ID and the various Product IDs are for the different controllers. ENV{ID_INPUT_TOUCHPAD}==\"?*\" & ENV{ID_INPUT_ACCELEROMETER}==\"?*\" specifically target the touchpad and accelerometer (gyro) devices for these controllers. Finally, the TAG+=\"uaccess\" gives users physically logged into your Steam Deck access to these devices (users like you ). Copy the file to etc/udev/rules.d/ (the location for user added rules) sudo mv 71 -chiaki4deck.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/71-chiaki4deck.rules Restart your Steam Deck Boot into chiaki4deck in Game Mode or Desktop Mode with a DualShock 4 or DualSense attached via usb or bluetooth and enjoy! Tested Against Ghost of Tsushima + Concrete Genie + What you Play Next! I successfully used a DualSense to test gyro using Concrete Genie and touchscreen using Ghost of Tsushima with the chiaki4deck flatpak. Try the next game yourself! Control Scheme for chiaki4deck using DualSense / DualShock 4 \u00b6 Make Sure your Controller is Connected for Configuration Your PlayStation controller needs to be connected via bluetooth or usb cable for its tab to show up when you visit the chiaki4deck game page on your Steam Deck and edit the saved controller configuration. This configuration is specifically for your PlayStation controller and separate from the Steam Deck controller configuration for chiaki4deck . It will be activated automatically when you use the PlayStation controller with chiaki4deck (it will show up as a 2 nd controller configuration since you will now have at least 2 active controllers [Steam Deck + PlayStation controller]) Mapping All chiaki4deck Controls (Recommended) Turning off Steam Input (Alternative Option) This tab shows you how to use Steam Input to map all of the controls for chiaki4deck to your PlayStation controller. This is great if you are using chiaki4deck with a TV. Since the PS Button maps to the STEAM button automatically and there are several commands in the default chiaki4deck configuration bound to back buttons (that don't exist on the PlayStation controllers), I have added these controls to a touch menu. It will show up when touching the left pad of the chiaki4deck controller. You have to click to select one of the extra commands (so you don't accidentally choose one during gameplay) from the radial menu. See the picture below for an example of what this looks like in-game: The easiest way to configure all of the necessary shortcuts for chiaki4deck on DualSense is to copy the profile I have created in the COMMUNITY LAYOUTS tab with the aforementioned touch menu for extra commands. DualShock 4 can also use a similar layout mapping. Add Default PlayStation Controller Mapping Go to the chiaki4deck game page Select the gamepad icon on the right hand side of the page to go the controller configuration menu Move to the controller configuration tab for your PlayStation controller (if not already there) Click the current layout box (it says: Browse Community Layouts for games without official controller support underneath it). Move to the COMMUNITY LAYOUTS tab and select DualSense by gmoney23 This is what the full mapping looks like for reference: Map it How you Want Using Steam Input there are a variety of ways to map controls. Do whatever you like best. Additionally, you can use gyro controls for camera options with games that don't support native gyro by mapping the gyro As joystick . Make sure to set an appropriate condition for when it's used (i.e., when holding R1 or Always On ) in the gyro settings for the PlayStation controller configuration option of chiaki4deck . For example, I have done this in the Steam Deck controller chiaki4deck control setting and you can do it for your DualSense control scheme as well. However, when playing games that have native gyro support (such as Concrete Genie or The Last of Us) you will most likely want to either temporarily turn off this option or make sure to set something to enable it that you won't hit accidentally. Otherwise, both the native gyro and the action you map will be done in-game which can make your camera move when you're trying to shake your flashlight, etc. You could also turn off Steam Input entirely to get as close to a native experience with your controller as possible (including the Home button serving as both the Steam and PlayStation button simultaneously). Won't Have Access to All chiaki4deck controls With this option you won't have access to all of the shortcuts for chiaki4deck (toggling stretch Ctrl + S and zoom Ctrl + Z screen options and quitting gracefully Ctrl + Q ) on your DualSense. However, if you have a keyboard connected to your Steam Deck, you can always use that for those shortcuts. Turn off Steam Input for your PlayStation controller by doing the following: Go to the chiaki4deck game page Select the gamepad icon on the right hand side of the page to go the controller configuration menu Move to the controller configuration tab for your PlayStation controller (if not already there) Click the gear icon to the right of Edit Layout Choose Disable Steam Input from the menu.","title":"Controller Options"},{"location":"setup/controlling/#configuring-steam-deck-controller-profile","text":"Get all of the shortcuts mapped to Steam Deck controls.

Pairing your DualShock 4 / DualSense with Steam Deck via Bluetooth While holding the Share button, hold the PlayStation Button to put your controller into pairing mode. On the Steam Deck, hit the STEAM button and then select the Settings tab and then the Bluetooth tab (i.e., STEAM button->Settings->Bluetooth ). Then, select your device from the list of devices. Once paired, it will automatically connect in the future when you press the PlayStation button on the controller.","title":"Using a DualSense and/or DualShock4 Controller with chiaki4deck"},{"location":"setup/controlling/#enabling-chiaki4deck-to-work-with-dualsense-dualshock-4-gyro-and-touchpad","text":"Password Required This requires setting a password for your Steam Deck (if you haven't already).

Udev rules control which devices you can access. The default rules for SteamOS give access to all joystick devices, but not touchpad or gyro devices because some of them are used in non-gaming electronics. Therefore, we need to give your user access to the PlayStation controllers' gyro and trackpad devices so chiaki4deck can read their events (so you can use the devices while playing). I have created and tested a file to give the minimum amount of permissions to accomplish what we need. 054c is Sony's Vendor ID and the various Product IDs are for the different controllers. ENV{ID_INPUT_TOUCHPAD}==\"?*\" & ENV{ID_INPUT_ACCELEROMETER}==\"?*\" specifically target the touchpad and accelerometer (gyro) devices for these controllers. Finally, the TAG+=\"uaccess\" gives users physically logged into your Steam Deck access to these devices (users like you ). Copy the file to etc/udev/rules.d/ (the location for user added rules) sudo mv 71 -chiaki4deck.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/71-chiaki4deck.rules Restart your Steam Deck Boot into chiaki4deck in Game Mode or Desktop Mode with a DualShock 4 or DualSense attached via usb or bluetooth and enjoy!

This configuration is specifically for your PlayStation controller and separate from the Steam Deck controller configuration for chiaki4deck . It will be activated automatically when you use the PlayStation controller with chiaki4deck (it will show up as a 2 nd controller configuration since you will now have at least 2 active controllers [Steam Deck + PlayStation controller]) Mapping All chiaki4deck Controls (Recommended) Turning off Steam Input (Alternative Option) This tab shows you how to use Steam Input to map all of the controls for chiaki4deck to your PlayStation controller. This is great if you are using chiaki4deck with a TV. Since the PS Button maps to the STEAM button automatically and there are several commands in the default chiaki4deck configuration bound to back buttons (that don't exist on the PlayStation controllers), I have added these controls to a touch menu. It will show up when touching the left pad of the chiaki4deck controller. You have to click to select one of the extra commands (so you don't accidentally choose one during gameplay) from the radial menu. See the picture below for an example of what this looks like in-game: The easiest way to configure all of the necessary shortcuts for chiaki4deck on DualSense is to copy the profile I have created in the COMMUNITY LAYOUTS tab with the aforementioned touch menu for extra commands. DualShock 4 can also use a similar layout mapping. Add Default PlayStation Controller Mapping Go to the chiaki4deck game page Select the gamepad icon on the right hand side of the page to go the controller configuration menu Move to the controller configuration tab for your PlayStation controller (if not already there) Click the current layout box (it says: Browse Community Layouts for games without official controller support underneath it). Move to the COMMUNITY LAYOUTS tab and select DualSense by gmoney23 This is what the full mapping looks like for reference: Map it How you Want Using Steam Input there are a variety of ways to map controls. Do whatever you like best. Additionally, you can use gyro controls for camera options with games that don't support native gyro by mapping the gyro As joystick . Make sure to set an appropriate condition for when it's used (i.e., when holding R1 or Always On ) in the gyro settings for the PlayStation controller configuration option of chiaki4deck . For example, I have done this in the Steam Deck controller chiaki4deck control setting and you can do it for your DualSense control scheme as well. However, when playing games that have native gyro support (such as Concrete Genie or The Last of Us) you will most likely want to either temporarily turn off this option or make sure to set something to enable it that you won't hit accidentally. Otherwise, both the native gyro and the action you map will be done in-game which can make your camera move when you're trying to shake your flashlight, etc. You could also turn off Steam Input entirely to get as close to a native experience with your controller as possible (including the Home button serving as both the Steam and PlayStation button simultaneously). Won't Have Access to All chiaki4deck controls With this option you won't have access to all of the shortcuts for chiaki4deck (toggling stretch Ctrl + S and zoom Ctrl + Z screen options and quitting gracefully Ctrl + Q ) on your DualSense. However, if you have a keyboard connected to your Steam Deck, you can always use that for those shortcuts. Turn off Steam Input for your PlayStation controller by doing the following: Go to the chiaki4deck game page Select the gamepad icon on the right hand side of the page to go the controller configuration menu Move to the controller configuration tab for your PlayStation controller (if not already there) Click the gear icon to the right of Edit Layout Choose Disable Steam Input from the menu.","title":"Control Scheme for chiaki4deck using DualSense / DualShock 4"},{"location":"setup/installation/","text":"Installing chiaki4deck \u00b6 Copying from and Pasting into Konsole Windows You can copy from and paste into konsole windows with Ctrl + Shift + C (copy) and Ctrl + Shift + V (paste) instead of the normal Ctrl + C (copy) and Ctrl + V (paste) shortcuts.

I added the patches to chiaki4deck and it results in a more accurate picture. Below is a BEFORE and AFTER from Ghost of Tsushima. BEFORE AFTER 3 view modes for non-standard screen sizes \u00b6 It's great to have these options for Steam Deck's non-standard 1280x800 resolution. Using These Options Without the Automation [Not Recommended] (click me to open) If for some strange reason you want to launch chiaki4deck via the GUI instead of the automation (not recommended due to the items noted here ), it launches by default in a window matching the aspect ratio of the stream (i.e., 16:9). This means that the stream output exactly matches the stream window. In this scenario, there is nothing to stretch or zoom the stream output to because the stream output already perfectly matches with the stream window. If you want to stretch or zoom, you would need to first either: Adjust the window to a bigger or smaller size with your mouse in Desktop Mode (perhaps you want to use chiaki4deck as half of your screen in Desktop mode) OR Use fullscreen mode by: Pressing F11 (either directly in Desktop Mode or via a controller mapping in Game Mode ) OR Double clicking on the screen in Desktop Mode Then, you could use stretch and/or zoom accordingly (i.e., Ctrl + S / Ctrl + Z or button mapped to them in game mode). Normal (default) [used for fullscreen launch option] Maintains aspect ratio, adds black bars to fill unused parts of screen Zoom using Ctrl + Z to toggle Maintains aspect ratio, cutting off edges to fill screen Stretch using Ctrl + S to toggle Stretches image (distorting aspect ratio) to fill screen Quit function Ctrl + Q \u00b6 Cleanly quits Chiaki, respecting the user's configuration option of either asking to put PlayStation console sleep, putting PlayStation console to sleep without asking, or leaving PlayStation console on. What does this do for me? Now, if you hit a back button (or other button) mapped to Ctrl + Q on your Steam Deck, your remote play session will shut down cleanly and put your console to sleep automatically if you so choose. This means you no longer have to manually put your console to sleep via a menu or the power button on the PlayStation console itself. Enabled Automated Launch \u00b6 This provides the following: Skips the need to visit the configuration screen and use the Steam Deck's touchscreen each time. Only 1 window is open during game streaming instead of 2, eliminating the flashing issue that would occur during accidental window switching by the Steam Deck's Game Mode Gives default game mode option to launch in fullscreen, stretch or zoomed mode. Passes login passcode automatically instead of manually typing it in each time. If you have to enter a passcode (4 digit pin) every time you boot up your PlayStation to play, you have a login passcode. If not, this doesn't affect you If you choose to not use the automation for whatever reason and have a PlayStation Login Passcode, you will need to do the following every time you launch chiaki4deck and login: Wait for the login passcode dialog box to appear. Use attached keyboard or Hit STEAM + X to bring up the on-screen Steam Deck virtual keyboard. Enter you passcode using the keyboard (either via touch or controller navigation) to login to your PlayStation console (use Enter / R2 to submit the passcode). I have added a helper script to generate a Chiaki-launcher.sh script as well as provided complete instructions in the Automation section . Enabled Touchpad and Gyro Controls with DualSense/DualShock 4 Controller for Flatpak \u00b6 This makes it as easy as possible for Steam Deck users to use touchpad and gyro support with their DualSense or DualShock 4 controller.

Using These Options Without the Automation [Not Recommended] (click me to open) If for some strange reason you want to launch chiaki4deck via the GUI instead of the automation (not recommended due to the items noted here ), it launches by default in a window matching the aspect ratio of the stream (i.e., 16:9). This means that the stream output exactly matches the stream window. In this scenario, there is nothing to stretch or zoom the stream output to because the stream output already perfectly matches with the stream window. If you want to stretch or zoom, you would need to first either: Adjust the window to a bigger or smaller size with your mouse in Desktop Mode (perhaps you want to use chiaki4deck as half of your screen in Desktop mode) OR Use fullscreen mode by: Pressing F11 (either directly in Desktop Mode or via a controller mapping in Game Mode ) OR Double clicking on the screen in Desktop Mode Then, you could use stretch and/or zoom accordingly (i.e., Ctrl + S / Ctrl + Z or button mapped to them in game mode). Normal (default) [used for fullscreen launch option] Maintains aspect ratio, adds black bars to fill unused parts of screen Zoom using Ctrl + Z to toggle Maintains aspect ratio, cutting off edges to fill screen Stretch using Ctrl + S to toggle Stretches image (distorting aspect ratio) to fill screen","title":"3 view modes for non-standard screen sizes"},{"location":"updates/done/#quit-function-ctrlq","text":"Cleanly quits Chiaki, respecting the user's configuration option of either asking to put PlayStation console sleep, putting PlayStation console to sleep without asking, or leaving PlayStation console on.
