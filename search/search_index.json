Currently, it employs an updated Chiaki package with Steam Deck enhancements I have dubbed chiaki4deck . I have created the accompanying chiaki4deck flatpak as a means to provide updates to Chiaki for Steam Deck users before they are added to the main project. Once the changes are merged into the main project and the project maintainers create a new flatpak release, this site will be updated to use the official Chiaki flatpak. Getting Started \u00b6 Start by visiting the Setup section and following each of the subsections to learn how to setup Chiaki for the best experience on your Steam Deck using chiaki4deck . Getting Updates \u00b6 Visit chiaki4deck Releases for instructions on updating to the newest release, with notes for each release. Additional Information \u00b6 About Chiaki \u00b6 Chiaki is a \"Free and Open Source PlayStation Remote Play Client\" licensed under the GNU Affero General Public License version 3 enabling users to share and modify the source code to add additional features on the condition that they make those publicly available. This package currently has an official flatpak on flathub which you can install on the Steam Deck. About chiaki4deck \u00b6 chiaki4deck aims to provide tips and tricks on using Chiaki with the Steam Deck. In the spirit of Chiaki being open source, I have made changes to the Chiaki project to optimize the experience on my Steam Deck and am sharing how to access and use those enhancements on this site. Furthermore, I have submitted a patch to bring the completed updates to the \"official\" Chiaki repo and at that point all of the chiaki4deck documentation here will apply to the main repo instead of needing the chiaki4deck flatpak. Additionally, I plan to submit any future updates as patches too. What is the chiaki4deck flatpak I have provided a flatpak with my updates named chiaki4deck (to distinguish it from the official Chiaki release to avoid confusion if users have both installed) as a solution for users that want an easy way to use these improvements on their Steam Deck. For installation instructions, see the Installation section For users that want to build from source, I have also provided the updated source code on the accompanying GitHub repo (the link to the GitHub is on the top right of the site banner you see if you scroll to the top of any page) as well as instructions in the DIY section . As it stands, a lot of the documentation applies to the general Chiaki flatpak in addition to the chiaki4deck flatpak, but instructions are specifically tailored to chiaki4deck and the updates included therein. To use this documentation with the Chiaki flatpak replace re.chiaki.Chiaki4deck with re.chiaki.Chiaki where applicable and note that the features listed in the Updates section will not work with that version (they only work with chiaki4deck until the main Chiaki flatpak gets an update.) Submitting Documentation Updates \u00b6 If you want to update the documentation to add helpful information of your own, you can scroll to the top of your current page and click the pencil icon on the top right (to the right of the current page's title) to make edits and submit them for approval. Making Suggestions for Improvements to the Documentation \u00b6 Please submit general issues to the chiaki4deck GitHub as well as specific issues related to a given page by clicking the underneath \"Was this page helpful?\" and opening the feedback form for the page you think needs updating. Acknowledgements \u00b6 Thanks to the following individuals: Chiaki Authors (including but not limited to Florian M\u00e4rkl) Reddit users and others who have helped me in my personal Chiaki journey such as u/mintcu7000 with his getting started guide on Reddit Authors \u00b6 Street Pea","title":"Home"},{"location":"#playstation-remote-play-on-steam-deck","text":"Site Purpose This site serves as a guide to enable you to have the best experience with PlayStation Remote Play on the Steam Deck.

So Why Should I Care? This is especially convenient for the Steam Deck's Game Mode where an automated launch eliminates both the need to tap furiously at your touchscreen to launch the application and the glitches that would arise (flashes on your screen) when it would switch between the 2 open Chiaki windows (since only 1 window is opened with the automated launch). Sleep Mode Required For this to work, your PlayStation needs to either be in rest/sleep mode or on (so that it is listening for the wake up signal). This means you will want to keep your PlayStation in rest/sleep mode when you are not playing (instead of off). Open a konsole session (launch it via Applications by clicking the Steam icon in the bottom left and searching for it in the All Applications section) Get your PlayStation IP Get your registered PlayStation's IP Address Launch Chiaki via your desktop or via: flatpak run re.chiaki.Chiaki4deck Get your IP address via the console widget and then close the window and return to the konsole session Create script for waking PlayStation and launching Chiaki Automated Instructions (Recommended) Manual Instructions (For People who like to do things by hand) Run the gen-launcher script using the following command in your konsole and answer the prompts (you will need your IP address from step 2 above) bash < ( curl -sLo- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streetpea/chiaki4deck/main/scripts/gen-launcher.sh ) What Do the Different Modes (i.e., fullscreen [uses Normal], zoom, stretch) Look Like?

This is where the flatpak version of Chiaki saves your settings and details. In fact, all flatpaks store their details with the ~/.var/app/app_id pattern. If you want to look at the file itself and get the value you can open the file at /home/deck/.var/app/re.chiaki.Chiaki4deck/config/Chiaki/Chiaki.conf and look for the remote play registration key [ rp_regist_key ]. Choose your default launch option (fullscreen, zoom, or stretch) fullscreen: A full screen picture with black bars, aspect ratio maintained zoom: A full screen zoomed picture with no black bars, aspect ratio maintained, edges of image cut off by zoom stretch: A full screen stretched picture with no black bars, aspect ratio slightly distorted by vertical [in the case of Steam Deck] stretch Default Launch Option This is the option remote play will launch with. You can always toggle to a different option by using the Ctrl + S (toggles between stretch and normal) and Ctrl + Z (toggles between zoom and normal) options which should be set if desired in the Steam controller configuration for the game. See Controller Configuration Section for more details.

So Why Should I Care? This is especially convenient for the Steam Deck's Game Mode where an automated launch eliminates both the need to tap furiously at your touchscreen to launch the application and the glitches that would arise (flashes on your screen) when it would switch between the 2 open Chiaki windows (since only 1 window is opened with the automated launch). Sleep Mode Required For this to work, your PlayStation needs to either be in rest/sleep mode or on (so that it is listening for the wake up signal). This means you will want to keep your PlayStation in rest/sleep mode when you are not playing (instead of off). Open a konsole session (launch it via Applications by clicking the Steam icon in the bottom left and searching for it in the All Applications section) Get your PlayStation IP Get your registered PlayStation's IP Address Launch Chiaki via your desktop or via: flatpak run re.chiaki.Chiaki4deck Get your IP address via the console widget and then close the window and return to the konsole session Create script for waking PlayStation and launching Chiaki Automated Instructions (Recommended) Manual Instructions (For People who like to do things by hand) Run the gen-launcher script using the following command in your konsole and answer the prompts (you will need your IP address from step 2 above) bash < ( curl -sLo- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/streetpea/chiaki4deck/main/scripts/gen-launcher.sh ) What Do the Different Modes (i.e., fullscreen [uses Normal], zoom, stretch) Look Like?

You can always toggle to a different option by using the Ctrl + S (toggles between stretch and normal) and Ctrl + Z (toggles between zoom and normal) options which should be set if desired in the Steam controller configuration for the game.

Make sure your Steam Deck is on the same wireless network as your PlayStation system and that the PlayStation console is either on or in sleep/rest mode.

You can even test launching a game if you want. Exit out of the window once you've tested the connection. It worked! It didn't work Purrfect You were able to launch your stream and connect. Maybe, you even got a game running. An error occurred Please try closing and re-launching to make sure it wasn't some sort of temporary snafu (maybe your console was updating something and didn't want to let you connect right away) Make sure your PlayStation shows as registered and is currently either on or in sleep mode. If it's not on or in sleep mode, you can't connect to it. Choosing your Remote Play Settings \u00b6 Here are different settings you can use for Chiaki/ chiaki4deck depending on your network connection. The default configuration is for remote play on a home network only, this means that it is dependent only on the performance / strength of your wireless router (or ethernet connection) [recommended to connect the PlayStation console via ethernet and Steam Deck via wi-fi to optimize performance and portability] and not on your Internet (World Wide Web) connection. What does that mean for me? If you are in an area with bad Internet, as long as you have a good wireless router, you can get close to native performance. Open chiaki4deck and click the gear icon in the top right to open the settings menu Adjust the settings to your preferences. Below are the settings you'll want to try first with your PlayStation console (choose the PS5/1080p tab if you have a PS5 or the PS4/720p if you have a PS4). If you are having issues with your PS5 connection, please try the PS4/720p settings with your PS5 since they require significantly less bandwidth from your wireless router. PS5/1080P PS4/720P Stream output can be up to 1080p. Here are the settings that are currently working well for me. This results in a native-like experience for most games on my network/setup. Why 1080p if the Steam Deck is only 800p? Using 1080p results in a better picture for me than 720p. The biggest factor in this seems to be chroma-sub sampling . In simple terms, the colors for an image are compressed and so you get a much lower resolution of color data than your image resolution. This means a 1080p image (with a high bitrate) will have more color data than a 720p image even if the image resolution itself ends up being 720p (since the color resolution will be higher than the equivalent 720p picture's color resolution). This results in an image that has more pop to it. Thus, I recommend streaming at 1080p if you have the bandwidth (good enough wireless router). However, if you are having issues with your wireless connection (i.e choppy audio, flashes in your video, or lag) while playing, then please use 720p instead. The gains you get from 1080p are nice, but aren't worth having a bad connection. For PS4, the stream is limited to 720p. Using the defaults for most values works well here, resulting in native-like (albeit w/ a diminished resolution) experience for most games on my network/setup. Putting your PlayStation Console to Sleep Automatically For Action on Disconnect , choose Enter Sleep Mode to automatically put your PlayStation console to sleep as soon as you close your session with Ctrl + Q (you will add this shortcut as part of you controller configuration in controller section ). If you prefer, you can also use Ask (the default) to get prompted about putting your PlayStation to sleep when you close your session (use Ctrl + Q ). Performance of Chiaki/ chiaki4deck \u00b6 My Experience \u00b6 Ultimately, the performance will depend on the capability of your wireless router and which system ( \\(PS5 > PS4 Pro > PS4\\) ) you are using. Here are some notes from my experience using chiaki4deck on my Steam Deck with a PS5 console and a relatively good ( \\(450 Mbps\\) for \\(2.4GHz\\) / \\(1,300 Mbps\\) for \\(5GHz\\) ) wireless router. My Wireless Connection by the Numbers I'm using the \\(5GHz\\) band for chiaki4deck on my Steam Deck, meaning the total bandwidth for all devices on my local network is \\(1,300 Mbps\\) (remember Internet connection itself doesn't matter since we're only using our wireless router for local streaming). Since I am using the settings in Choosing Your Remote Play Settings , I'm using \\((30,000 + 19,200) Kbps \\approx 50 Mbps\\) out of the total of \\(1,300 Mbps\\) . This means I'm using about \\(4\\%\\) of my \\(5GHz\\) band. In other words, I still have plenty of bandwidth for watching Netflix while I play on my Steam Deck! What Performance Can I Expect? I am currently getting close to native performance using chiaki4deck on my Steam Deck with my PS5. This gives me better performance than I get playing performance heavy games directly on Steam Deck (like that one game where the kid gets bit by a ) Benefits: 5-6 hours of battery life (vs 1-2 hours playing the same games natively on Steam Deck) access to PlayStation collection (games I have already purchased or have via PS Plus) including exclusives Steam Deck quiet as a mouse (especially important when playing while watching a show with others) PlayStation Trophies Negatives: occasional performance issues with certain games (specifically games with VSync enabled) lack of touchpad gesture and gyro controls for games that require these lack of native microphone support (I use Discord with my friends so not an issue for me, but could be for others). Games I've Played Successfully Using chiaki4deck So Far... Stray God of War (2018) Genshin Impact (turned off VSync in settings to get rid of white flashes during gameplay) Sekiro (occasional white flashes in areas with high crowds. These went away as I got further in the game and never affected my ability to progress. Unfortunately, this seems to be due to VSync being enabled automatically with no option to turn it off. Luckily, the framerate is very solid on PS5 so it happens infrequently (at its peak there was 1 flash every 15 minutes. It only affected about 3 hours of the game in total.) Fall Guys MultiVersus Red Dead Redemption 2 Marvel's Spider Man Troubleshooting Performance Issues \u00b6 Examples of performance issues white flashes green flashes audio choppiness/crackling excessive lag To fix these issues, try the following: If you are not using the settings listed in Choosing Your Remote Play Settings , try with those settings and see if that fixes it for you. Switch to 720p from 1080p 720p requires less bandwidth than 1080p. This help if your wireless connection is the problem, especially since it's very easy to do. This can fix video artifacts (white / green flashes) and audio choppiness (both results of connection problems). Try short preamble If you are still having trouble (I didn\u2019t need this but it can help in general and helped significantly improve performance for other streaming services such as Game Pass on my Steam Deck), try using using short preamble instead of long preamble in your router settings. You need to change this directly in your router settings for the given network and can do it per network if you set up more than one. This is incompatible with old devices (using wifi b/g instead of n or ac). Devices from 2011 and newer are required by law to support it and so will definitely work. Older devices may or may not support it depending on if they have either n or ac wireless support. Short preamble helps the \\(5GHz\\) connection for devices that support it (essentially anything that\u2019s connecting on a \\(5GHz\\) network should use it). For streaming, you can set up one network that uses short for your newer devices ( \\(5GHz\\) network for me) and one with long for older devices ( \\(2.4 GHz\\) network for me since older devices don\u2019t support \\(5GHz\\) anyway). My connection worked fine with long preamble on a \\(2.4 GHz\\) network for Chiaki but short (and a \\(5GHz\\) network for that matter) works better in general for devices that support it and has helped others using Chiaki as well as me to help reduce Game Pass streaming lag (which is still much worse than Chiaki and not close to native, but works well for games that don\u2019t require fast or moderately fast reaction times). Turn off VSync or the equivalent in games that use it VSync should only be enabled on the client side while streaming and having it enabled in the game itself can cause issues since it requires some extra overhead and can't actually sync with your screen if you're streaming the game. This resulted in issues with white flashes for me while playing Genshin Impact and Sekiro. When I turned off VSync in the Genshin Impact settings, these flashes (which had happened multiple times a minute with VSync on) disappeared. This affects only a small number of games, but is something to watch out for if you randomly have an issue with one game while others run well with Chiaki/ chiaki4deck . Chiaki/ chiaki4deck via Internet (Outside of Home Connection) \u00b6 Chiaki/ chiaki4deck Outside of your Home Network You can also open up ports to connect from the Internet, but the performance will not be as good, with increased input lag being the most noticeable downgrade. In this scenario, your connection will depend on both the Internet connection of your PlayStation console via the router and the Internet connection of your computer via your location (internet speeds themselves will apply). The farther away (more hops from your router) you get, the worse the performance will get. If you are still in the same state, it will likely still be relatively good.

The left trackpad is the PlayStation button and the right trackpad is a PlayStation controller touchpad click. Default chiaki4deck Layout Back Button Mapping \u00b6 I have mapped L4 to the PlayStation button, L5 to end session ( Ctrl + Q ), R4 to zoom ( Ctrl + Z ), and R5 to stretch ( Ctrl + S ). Default chiaki4deck Layout Gyro Mapping \u00b6 I have also mapped gyro controls As joystick . Whenever you touch the right joystick or trackpad, you can move the Steam Deck to aim / control the camera with motion (gyro) controls in addition to moving the right joystick. You can always change this by choosing to edit the layout and going into the gyro settings.

In order to get around this, you can either: Remap controls in accessibility options if the specific game supports that. Connect a DualSense or DualShock4 controller following Using a DualSense and/or DualShock4 Controller with chiaki4deck below. In the future, I plan to update chiaki4deck to support native gyro and touch for the Steam Deck controller. This affects a small subset of games. However, it is important to note when thinking of which games to play with Chiaki/ chiaki4deck . Additionally, you can use gyro controls for camera options with any game (with gyro in the game itself turned off) by mapping gyro As joystick and adding a condition for when it's used (i.e., On with a condition of right touchpad or right joystick touch ) in the gyro settings for chiaki4deck . I have done this in the default chiaki4deck control setting and you can do it in your custom control scheme. Using a DualSense and/or DualShock4 Controller with chiaki4deck \u00b6 While most users will want to just use chiaki4deck with the Steam Deck controller, you can also attach a DualShock 4 or DualSense controller via bluetooth or usbc. The controls will map automatically and there is even native touchpad (including gestures) and gyro support. This can be especially useful if you're playing chiaki4deck when connected to an external monitor or TV or if you just really like the feel of the traditional PlayStation controllers. Pairing your DualShock 4 / DualSense with Steam Deck via Bluetooth While holding the Share button, hold the PlayStation Button to put your controller into pairing mode. On the Steam Deck, hit the STEAM button and then select the Settings tab and then the Bluetooth tab (i.e., STEAM button->Settings->Bluetooth ). Then, select your device from the list of devices. Once paired, it will automatically connect in the future when you press the PlayStation button on the controller. Enabling chiaki4deck to Work with DualSense / DualShock 4 Gyro and Touchpad \u00b6 Password Required This requires setting a password for your Steam Deck (if you haven't already). This is because you have to give access to the PlayStation controllers' accelerometer/gyroscope and touchpad to your user so that chiaki4deck can read them using libevdev . This itself is not dangerous, but changing udev rules in general can be which is why this is a restricted action that requires the use of sudo (with a password). Once you set your password, you need to make sure you put it in your password manager or remember it. Otherwise, if you ever need to use a command that requires a password again, you won't be able to use it and will have to use the recovery instructions for the Steam Deck .

Udev rules control which devices you can access. The default rules for SteamOS give access to all joystick devices, but not touchpad or gyro devices because some of them are used in non-gaming electronics. Therefore, we need to give your user access to the PlayStation controllers' gyro and trackpad devices so chiaki4deck can read their events (so you can use the devices while playing). I have created and tested a file to give the minimum amount of permissions to accomplish what we need. 054c is Sony's Vendor ID and the various Product IDs are for the different controllers. ENV{ID_INPUT_TOUCHPAD}==\"?*\" & ENV{ID_INPUT_ACCELEROMETER}==\"?*\" specifically target the touchpad and accelerometer (gyro) devices for these controllers. Finally, the TAG+=\"uaccess\" gives users physically logged into your Steam Deck access to these devices (users like you ).

It will be activated automatically when you use the PlayStation controller with chiaki4deck (it will show up as a 2 nd controller configuration since you will now have at least 2 active controllers [Steam Deck + PlayStation controlller]) Mapping All chiaki4deck Controls (Recommended) Turning off Steam Input (Alternative Option) This tab shows you how to use Steam Input to map all of the controls for chiaki4deck to your PlayStation controller. This is great if you are using chiaki4deck with a TV. Since the PS Button maps to the STEAM button automatically and there are several commands in the default chiaki4deck configuration bound to back buttons (that don't exist on the PlayStation controllers), I have added these controls to a touch menu. It will show up when touching the left pad of the chiaki4deck controller. You have to click to select one of the extra commands (so you don't accidentally choose one during gameplay) from the radial menu. See the picture below for an example of what this looks like in-game: The easiest way to configure all of the necessary shortcuts for chiaki4deck on DualSense is to copy the profile I have created in the COMMUNITY LAYOUTS tab with the aforementioned touch menu for extra commands. DualShock 4 can also use a similar layout mapping. Add Default PlayStation Controller Mapping Go to the chiaki4deck game page Select the gamepad icon on the right hand side of the page to go the controller configuration menu Move to the controller configuration tab for your PlayStation controller (if not already there) Click the current layout box (it says: Browse Community Layouts for games without official controller support underneath it). Move to the COMMUNITY LAYOUTS tab and select DualSense by gmoney23 This is what the full mapping looks like for reference: Map it How you Want Using Steam Input there are a variety of ways to map controls. Do whatever you like best. Additionally, you can use gyro controls for camera options with games that don't support native gyro by mapping the gyro As joystick . Make sure to set an appropriate condition for when it's used (i.e., when holding R1 or Always On ) in the gyro settings for the PlayStation controller configuration option of chiaki4deck . For example, I have done this in the Steam Deck controller chiaki4deck control setting and you can do it for your DualSense control scheme as well. However, when playing games that have native gyro support (such as Concrete Genie or The Last of Us) you will most likely want to either temporarily turn off this option or make sure to set something to enable it that you won't hit accidentally. Otherwise, both the native gyro and the action you map will be done in-game which can make your camera move when you're trying to shake your flashlight, etc. You could also turn off Steam Input entirely to get as close to a native experience with your controller as possible (including the Home button serving as both the Steam and PlayStation button simultaneously). Won't Have Access to All chiaki4deck controls With this option you won't have access to all of the shortcuts for chiaki4deck (toggling stretch Ctrl + S and zoom Ctrl + Z screen options and quitting gracefully Ctrl + Q ) on your DualSense. However, if you have a keyboard connected to your Steam Deck, you can always use that for those shortcuts. Turn off Steam Input for your PlayStation controller by doing the following: Go to the chiaki4deck game page Select the gamepad icon on the right hand side of the page to go the controller configuration menu Move to the controller configuration tab for your PlayStation controller (if not already there) Click the gear icon to the right of Edit Layout Choose Disable Steam Input from the menu.","title":"Controller Options"},{"location":"setup/controlling/#configuring-steam-deck-controller-profile","text":"Get all of the shortcuts mapped to Steam Deck controls.

Udev rules control which devices you can access. The default rules for SteamOS give access to all joystick devices, but not touchpad or gyro devices because some of them are used in non-gaming electronics. Therefore, we need to give your user access to the PlayStation controllers' gyro and trackpad devices so chiaki4deck can read their events (so you can use the devices while playing). I have created and tested a file to give the minimum amount of permissions to accomplish what we need. 054c is Sony's Vendor ID and the various Product IDs are for the different controllers. ENV{ID_INPUT_TOUCHPAD}==\"?*\" & ENV{ID_INPUT_ACCELEROMETER}==\"?*\" specifically target the touchpad and accelerometer (gyro) devices for these controllers. Finally, the TAG+=\"uaccess\" gives users physically logged into your Steam Deck access to these devices (users like you ). Copy the file to etc/udev/rules.d/ (the location for user added rules) sudo cp 71 -chiaki4deck.rules /etc/udev/rules.d/71-chiaki4deck.rules Restart your Steam Deck Boot into chiaki4deck in Game Mode or Desktop Mode with a DualShock 4 or DualSense attached via usb or bluetooth and enjoy!

Given the current state of the Chiaki project (maintenance mode), I'm not sure if the maintainers will accept new changes. I have submitted the current updates upstream to Chiaki and hope that they are accepted despite Chiaki being in maintenance mode. In the meantime, I have created chiaki4deck as a means to distribute these changes to others using the Steam Deck as well as others wanting to add additional beneficial features on top of mine. Currently, I am aiming to make chiaki4deck work for all traditional Chiaki users (may not benefit other users as much as Steam Deck users, but wouldn't be bad for those users either).","title":"chiaki4deck Updates"},{"location":"updates/done/","text":"Completed (Done) Updates \u00b6 3 view modes for non-standard screen sizes \u00b6 It's great to have these options for Steam Deck's non-standard 1280x800 resolution Normal (default) [used for fullscreen launch option] Maintains aspect ratio, adds black bars to fill unused parts of screen Zoom using Ctrl + Z to toggle Maintains aspect ratio, cutting off edges to fill screen Stretch using Ctrl + S to toggle Stretches image (distorting aspect ratio) to fill screen Quit function Ctrl + Q \u00b6 Cleanly quits Chiaki, respecting the user's configuration option of either asking to put PlayStation console sleep, putting PlayStation console to sleep without asking, or leaving PlayStation console on. What does this do for me? Now, if you hit a back button (or other button) mapped to Ctrl + Q on your Steam Deck, your remote play session will shut down cleanly and put your console to sleep automatically if you so choose. This means you no longer have to manually put your console to sleep via a menu or the power button on the PlayStation console itself.

Additionally, only 1 window is open during game streaming instead of 2, eliminating the flashing issue that would occur during accidental window switching by the Steam Deck's Game Mode .
